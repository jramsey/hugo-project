title: ruby = [], ruby << javascript
---

JavaScript is coming back to me more and more as I'm getting back into it. I have to say it's a bit frustrating at times but that's fine. I look back at how Ruby was frustrating when I started and how I enjoy it so much now (most of the time).  Okay. I'm beat. It was a long day. I don't think I'll even publish this tonight because it's not even a full paragraph. Just wanted to get it down on the screen for now.

Actually, I'll publish this. I just won't mirror it over to Medium tonight.
